# AI

To solve this problem copy the contents of source.txt and go to http://codertab.com/jsunfuck. You'll get `Congrats, you've uncovered the truth! Now go to ibarakaiev.shpp.me/pactf_s7fj43/ai.zip`.
Download the archive and open the HTML page. You'll see a broken terminal. To fix it click F12, open Console and check the error. You'll need to go to `assets/js/script.js` and change `startt("Hello World")` to `start("Hello World")`. Everything will now execute except that it will launch the stupid version of AI. On line 103 change `true` to `false`. It will now launch the "smart" AI that will write some text. The last phrase says `The key is now stored securely in ("ibarakaiev.shpp.me/pactf_s7fj43/key_%d.txt", get_key_number([16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8]))`. From here it is clear that you have to implement get_key_number() as described to get the number. The solution is to simply add absolute values of numbers in an array. Thus, you'll get 120. Go to http://ibarakaiev.shpp.me/pactf_s7fj43/key_120.txt. There is a string written with "byfes" (bytes consisting of 5 bits) and an ASCII-like table called PACTFSCII. Use it to get number representation of the string. From `mrxwozAp` you'll get `12-17-23-22-14-25-27-15`. Convert it to binary to get 01100 10001 10111 10110 01110 11001 11011 01111. Remove spaces and go to https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html. Enter the binary to get the flag.

The flag is `doggo`.
