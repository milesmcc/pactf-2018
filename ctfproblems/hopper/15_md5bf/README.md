# MD5 Brute-Force
This is a really simple problem. Through a somewhat contrived setup, the contestant is given the
task of breaking an MD5 hash given the knowledge it's six characters of lowercase. This is doable
through brute force. On my machine it took 7 minutes to break with a home-grown Python program that
can't be very optimized and one that I seriously doubts uses a GPU or anything.

This is mainly just a PSA to all of the future web developers: don't use MD5! Salt your passwords!

# Flag
The flag is `lmaoez`. It matches the IRC hacker vibe.
