# Library of Babel

The quickest way to solve this problem is to extract frames from video (for example, using ffmpeg) and write a [script](https://gist.github.com/ibarakaiev/18282531e6bcdf9c980098f607af40bf) to decode QR-codes. Now that we have [full text](https://gist.github.com/ibarakaiev/8b3c164ff95528033b44c5938eda76e9), note the answer in the middle. Google [Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/) and use the information in the text from QR codes to find the book and the page with the flag.

The flag is `averyunobviouskey`.
