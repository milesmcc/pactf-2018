  I love lots of things about my school, [Phillips Academy Andover](https://www.andover.edu/). But most of
  all, I love its school color: a soothing shade of blue. I couldn't just tell you the hex code for
  the color; that wouldn't be enough! I think a 128 x 128 PNG file is probably a better method of
  conveying its utter beauty. That's not suspicious, right? Gaze upon its beauty!

  Did you know there are 16,777,216 possible RGB colors, and only one of them is Andover blue? I
  wonder if you could even tell the difference between all of them...
