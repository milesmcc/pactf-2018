  We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its
  future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and
  all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to
  submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest
  bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be
  uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.
