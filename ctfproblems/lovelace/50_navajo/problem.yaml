  We intercepted this message, but we can't make heads or tails of it. It was rattled off so fast, too... How could anyone be that good at using a cipher?

  Anyway, here's the message. Good luck!

  ```Tązhii, Łį́į́ʼ, Dzeeh
  Mąʼii, Dibé yázhí, Wóláchííʼ, Tłʼízí
  Tin, Dibé
  Mósí, Łį́į́ʼ, Dzeeh, Dibé, Tązhii, Dzeeh, Gah, Neeshchʼííʼ, Dzeeh, Béésh dootłʼizh```

  This definitely doesn't look like English. What else could it be? Perhaps looking through the history books might help...
