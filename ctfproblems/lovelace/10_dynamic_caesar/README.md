# Straight From The Emperor

This is a simple Caesar cipher, a modified ROT 5 (`1337 % 36 (+10 for numbers)`) with numbers. This is also a _dynamic problem_, so each team will see a slightly different version. This helps us catch cheaters.

The flag is `it_is_only_uphill_from_here_{team unique key}`.
