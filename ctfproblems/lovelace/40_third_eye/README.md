# Third Eye

This problem presents the competitor with a piece of text which reads `Sometimes there is more than meets the eye.` Hidden inside this message are a series of zero-width characters. When isolated, the zero-width characters (zero-width space and zero-width joiner) form a binary pattern. Considering a zero-width space to be 0 and a zero-width joiner to be 1, the following binary message is found:

`01110111011010000110000101110100010111110110010101101100011100110110010101011111011011000111010101110010011010110111001101011111011000100110010101101110011001010110000101110100011010000101111101110100011010000110010101011111011001010111100101100101`

This converts via ASCII to `what_else_lurks_beneath_the_eye`, which is the flag.
