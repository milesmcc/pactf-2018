name: Credit Card Leak
points: 35
description: |
  ShoeShop was hacked, and all of their customer records were released onlineâ€”including credit card numbers. One credit card in the leak is invalid, however. What is the invalid credit card number?

  Here's the leak: [cc_leak.txt.bz2]({% ctflexstatic 'cc_leak.txt.bz2' %})
hint: |
  The credit card numbers in the leak are obviously _all_ invalid, but most would pass a certain credit card validity test. All credit card numbers except one, that is.
