# Open Sourcery 2018

Last year, Tony submitted `pactf-flag-4boxdpa21ogonzkcrs9p.com` to the Chromium HSTS preload list so that the string would be included in the Chromium source code, but it took too long for the change to be pulled into the main source code that we had to use a different domain.

This year, `pactf-flag-4boxdpa21ogonzkcrs9p.com` is included in the Chromium source code (in the HSTS preload list) and is therefore suitable for the problem.

The flag is `pactf-flag-4boxdpa21ogonzkcrs9p.com`.
