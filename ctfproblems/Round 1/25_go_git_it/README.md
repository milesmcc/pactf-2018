# Go Git It

The competitor must find the commit referenced by no branch and in no historyâ€”it is an orphan and can only be found by detaching the head! The commit is `01ab3947246a08dcddf71056c330473bbb58d0ed`, and observing the `git diff` for that commit will show that a line was added to the end of `README.md` that is the flag.

The flag is `3x3rc1z3_caut10n_wh3n_d3tach1ng_ur_h3ad`.
