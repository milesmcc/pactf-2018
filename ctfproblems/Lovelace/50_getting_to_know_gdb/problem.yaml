  A friend sent me a [mysterious binary]({% ctflexstatic 'mysterious_elf' %}). It's supposed to print out the flag, but it's giving me a weird poem and some hex instead.
hint: |
  The flag is _in there somewhere_, but something gives me the feeling that searching the binary for strings wont help...
