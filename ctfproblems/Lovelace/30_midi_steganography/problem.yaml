  Our musician friend Martin recently bought a melody pack containing different melodies recorded in MIDI format. He hoped to use them in his electronic
  music tracks and then pretend that he was the person who actually wrote them. He spent a solid hundred dollars, but the website selling sample
  packs fooled him! Instead of 10 wonderful melodies, he only received one MIDI file. It sounded awful, and Martin quickly noticed why!

  Can you notice why?

  How would you edit MIDI?
